Welcome to my Golang knowledge base, based on experience and best practices for developing in this language. Here you will find detailed articles on various aspects of Go, including data types, runtime, concurrency, and the standard library. This is not official documentation, but rather a collection of useful information and tips for developers that are often encountered when working with Go.
